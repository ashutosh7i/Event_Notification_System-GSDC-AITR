there are two files to be created before using the programme,

The first one is the recipients.txt which contains the names and email addresses of the recipients in a defined manner given below-
#the file should begin with the firstName_surName.
#then there should be -&&- this combinations for characters irrespective of the space between them
#then the respective email of the recipient.
this should be format of recipients.txt file.
a example given below=
recipient.txt=  {         Aashutosh_Soni-&&-Ashutoshsonitest@gmail.com
                        Sundar_Pichai-&&-hisemail@gmail.com
                        Ratan_Tata-&&-Hisemail@tata.in
                        etc etc.
                }

The second file is format.txt, which contains the matter to be sent to the user ,
but to make it more involving or user friendly, variable names should be used in place of user name and surname and user email.
At the time of execution, the program will automatically put these variables from the recipients.txt file and will send it to same email account.
the format should look like this=
format.txt=     {   #%Invitation for you for GSOC 2022.

#Technologies Used-
## Frontend:
* HTML.
* CSS.
* JavaScript.

## Backend:
* PHP 8
* PHP Mailer Library
* SMTP server with Apache

# Project Description

The program takes a list of people's email addresses in a text file, named recipients.txt, and a pre-made email format named format.html. The name of recipients will be marked as #^receipients in the email format, and the program will automatically replace these variables with the actual name and other details of the recipients. The program will then automatically send the emails to the respective email IDs from an internal mail ID. This makes the process of sending bulk emails much easier and hassle-free.
